List of instances blocked by chaos.social
=======

This is a list of Mastodon/GNU Social instances blocked by [chaos.social](https://chaos.social). If you think an
instance has been unfairly blocked, please contact the administrators [@ordnung](https://chaos.social/@ordnung).

The purpose of this list is to be transparent towards our users, and to collaborate with other admins on identifying
those instances that violate the Code of Conduct, or those that tend to contain bad actors, and who boost unwanted
content into other instances. Instances that don't exist anymore are removed periodically.

### Footnotes

Â¹ Silenced ðŸ”‡ vs suspended â›”: Silenced instances don't appear in the Federated timeline, but their accounts can still
be seen, e.g. by searching for them, by interacting with them in conversations, or by following them.

Â² "Free speech zone": A place where it's okay to promote e.g. National Socialism because the argument is that open
discussion is more important than people's sensitivities or the denazification laws of Germany/France/etc.

Â³ "lolicon": sexualized depictions of children
