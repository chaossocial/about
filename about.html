<p><em>"Be excellent to each other"</em> is easier said than done, and means different things to different people.</p>
<p>Therefore we created our own house rules. Please read them before signing up. Any violation of any of those may lead to deletion of toots, silencing or suspension of accounts, at the descretion of the instance administrators. Usually, we'd tell you a couple of times in advance, before taking any of these measures.</p>

<h2>General behaviour</h2>

<p>
This is our Code of Conduct, consisting in a (non-exhaustive) list of behaviours that we do not tolerate:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Harrassment, stalking, doxxing</li>
<li>Racism, sexism, verbal abuse or advocation thereof</li>
<li>Discrimination against gender and sexual minorities, or advocation thereof</li>
<li>Violent nationalist propaganda, Nazi symbolism or promoting the ideology of National Socialism</li>
<li>Contacting people who made clear they want no contact. Dogpiling/brigading</li>
<li>Untagged sexual content, gore, or advertisement</li>
<li>Untagged, or automated, or excessive advertisement</li>
<li>Bots interacting with users without their explicit requests</li>
<li>Spamming: If you or your bot need to post with a high frequency, please restrict your posts to your followers to keep the local timeline readable.</li>
<li>We are not a "free speech zone.", a term established by right-wing groups to defend their publishing of racist, sexist, abusive, or otherwise inacceptable content.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Please report behaviour that bothers you.
That includes behaviour from other instances - we have no problem with stopping to federate with asshole instances, or suspend contact with single accounts.
</p>

<h2>Automated posts</h2>

<p>
We try to keep the <a href="https://chaos.social/web/timelines/public/local">local timeline</a> of our instance and the Fediverse in general a place of dialogue and human interaction. Therefore you must configure all automated posts to be <strong>unlisted</strong>! This means they will be only visible on your personal timeline and for your followers. This refers to all kind of automated posts, regardless if they are bots or any kind of feed poster or Twitter "Retweets". In case of crossposts (for example with Twitter) they must be "unlisted", too, whenever they include broken mentiones or they are not themselve in an understandable context.
</p>

<strong>Note on "Retweets":</strong>

<p>
In Mastodon and the Fediverse "Boosts", which are similar to "Retweets" in Twitter, are handled a bit differently: They are always published as "unlisted", which means they won't appear neither on the <a href="https://chaos.social/web/timelines/public/local">local</a> nor on the <a href="https://chaos.social/web/timelines/public">federated timeline</a>. Therefore we don't tolerate "Retweets" that are not marked as "unlisted".
