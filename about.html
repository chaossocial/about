<p>
<em>"Be excellent to each other"</em> is easier said than done, and means different things to different people.
</p>
<p>
The following rules are a (non-exhaustive) list of behaviours that may lead to deletion of toots, silencing or suspension of accounts, at the descretion of the instance administrators.
</p>
<p>
Please report behaviour that bothers you. We will keep your report confidential.
</p>
<ul>
<li>We do not tolerate harrassment, stalking, and doxxing.</li>
<li>We do not tolerate racism, sexism, verbal abuse, discrimination against gender and sexual minorities, or the advocation of any of these.</li>
<li>We do not tolerate violent nationalist propaganda, Nazi symbolism or promoting the ideology of National Socialism.</li>
<li>Do not contact people who made clear they want no contact. This includes dogpiling/brigading.</li>
<li>Posts with sexual content or gore have to be tagged.</li>
<li>Advertisements have to be tagged, and must not be excessive or automated.</li>
<li>Automated posts should be <strong>unlisted</strong> (rendering visible to everybody, but not appearing on the local timeline) to keep the local timeline of our instance a place of community dialogue and human interaction. This extends to bots, feed posters, Twitter "retweets" and Twitter crossposts with broken mentions.</li>
<li>Bots may only interact with a user when they're invited by that user to do so.</li>
<li>If you need to post with a high frequency, please set your posts to be <strong>unlisted</strong> to keep the local timeline readable.</li>
</ul>
