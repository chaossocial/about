This page contains both our <a href="#terms">Terms of Service</a> (adapted from the bsd.network ToS) and our <a href="#privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.

<h2 id="terms">chaos.social Terms of Service</h2>

<p>It is our intention that you use this service for personal enjoyment and respectful, friendly interaction. To that end, we hope to foster a welcoming and inclusive environment.</p>

<p>The server is privately owned and open to users voluntarily, not a public space. Users wishing to join this community are expected to act without malice and in good faith. Doing otherwise may lead to removal from the service, independent of whether a user violates any rules outlined below.</p>

<p>The administrators and moderators of this instance are <a href="https://chaos.social/@leah">@leah</a> and <a href="https://chaos.social/@rixx">@rixx</a>.</p>

<p>The server hosting the instance is located in Germany.</p>

<p>The following statements apply regardless of privacy level and instance of the users involved. In rare cases, public or private offline conduct or conduct on a separate instance may constitute grounds for removal from the service.</p>

<hr class="spacer" />

<h3>Policies and Rules</h3>

<p>Our instance is subject to a set of rules governing user behaviour. The rules are always visible on our <a href="https://chaos.social/about/more">about page</a> and in our <a href="https://github.com/chaossocial/about/blob/master/about.html">public repository</a>.</p>

<p>These rules are designed to maintain a friendly and open atmosphere, and to prevent harassment and discrimination. As such, they are a set of guidelines, but by necessity incomplete. Users violating the spirit of these rules will be treated no differently than users violating a specific rule.</p>

<p>Please note that our rules contain a section on best practices, and users who repeatedly and despite warnings disregard these best practices may be seen to be in violation of our rules.</p>

<p>The moderators may remove accounts who spam the instance, or are suspected of camping just to reserve an account name. Violation of the policies and rules may also lead to account removal at the discretion of the moderators.</p>

<h3>Data Access</h3>

<p>Content on this instance should not be used for the purposes of machine learning or other "research" purposes without the explicit consent of the users involved.</p>

<p>Content on this instance beyond this page should not be archived or indexed wholesale by automated means by any user or service. Active users may export their following lists and post content through the web interface.</p>

<h2 id="privacy">chaos.social Privacy Policy</h2>

<h3 id="collect">Information collection</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>Mandatory account information</em>: Username (always public), e-mail address, and password.</li>
  <li><em>Optional account information</em>: Display name, biography, profile information fields, profile picture, and header image. Display name, biography, profile picture and header image will always be public.</li>
  <li><em>Statuses and interactions</em>: We retain all your posts including attachments, and other interactions (such as favourites, follows and reblogs). In addition to the content and people involved, we also store the timestamps for all of the listed data entries. If these interactions impact another server (eg. following, boosting, or messaging a user on a different server), this other server will receive all required information. Public, unlisted, and pinned posts are available publicly. Follower-only posts are available to your followers, and direct messages are available to you and all people mentioned in the message. Please note that since we cannot control other servers, this means that we cannot guarantee the privacy status of your messages as soon as they leave our server.</li>
  <li><em>Cookies</em>: We use cookies to keep you logged in and save your preferences for future visits.</li>
  <li><em>Other metadata</em>: We do not log or store your IP address. We retain the name of your browser application to allow you to review your currently logged in sessions for security reasons.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="spacer" />

<h3 id="use">Information usage</h3>

<p>Any of the information we collect from you may be used in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To provide the core functionality of Mastodon. You can only interact with other people's content and post your own content when you are logged in. For example, you may follow other people to view their combined posts in your own personalized home timeline.</li>
  <li>To aid moderation of the community â€“ when a status or account is reported, we will look into the matter as part of our moderation tasks.</li>
  <li>The email address you provide may be used to send you information, notifications about other people interacting with your content or sending you messages, and to respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.</li>
</ul>

<hr class="spacer" />

<h3 id="protect">Information protection</h3>

<p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. Among other things, your browser session, as well as the traffic between your applications and the API, are secured with SSL, and your password is hashed using a strong one-way algorithm. You may enable two-factor authentication to further secure access to your account.</p>

<hr class="spacer" />

<h3 id="data-retention">Information deletion and retention</h3>

<p>You can request and download an archive of your content, including your posts, media attachments, profile picture, and header image.</p>

<p>You may irreversibly delete your account at any time.</p>

<p>If we judge you to be breaking our instance rules, we may irreversibly delete your account at any time.</p>


<hr class="spacer" />

<h3 id="disclose">Information disclosure</h3>

<p>Information is not disclosed unless you explicitly permit it. The only exception is the provider of our server, who is a trusted and unavoidable third party.</p>

<p>Contacting or permitting contact from a user from a different instance implies your consent that the required data is shared with the server in question.</p>

<p>Authorization of a third-party application grants information access depending on the scope of permissions you approve. The application may access your public profile information, your following list, your followers, your lists, all your posts, and your favourites. Applications can never access your e-mail address or password.</p>
